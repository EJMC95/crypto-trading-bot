"""golive_readiness.py — grade every shadow book against the go-live bar.

WHY (2026-07-29, operator: "give the carry book a promotion path, and fix the
gate that would reject it").

TWO PIPELINES, and conflating them is why the best book had no path:
  * The EXPERIMENT JUDGE re-parameterises a book that is ALREADY live — it
    needs a live arm to pair the shadow against. `perps-funding-carry-lshadow`
    has no live arm, so the judge can never reach it. That is not an oversight
    in the judge; it is the wrong pipeline for the question.
  * A NEW book's path to real money is the GO-LIVE GATE. It had no
    implementation at all — the rule lived in CLAUDE.md as prose and was
    applied by hand, which is how it went un-noticed that it would reject the
    fleet's best-evidenced book.

THE GATE DEFECT. CLAUDE.md's rule reads: *"Paper trading only until 30-day win
rate > 55% AND max drawdown < 15%"*. Measured 29-Jul, the carry book is the
fleet's strongest by every evidence measure — t=2.42 on n=80, both halves
positive (+42.42 / +13.78), realised +$56.20, unrealised +$7.62 (so the
hedged-book "close only when paid" artifact is NOT masking open losses),
maxDD −$6.13 — and it **wins 38.8% of its trades**. It is a low-win-rate,
positive-expectancy book, and a win-rate gate is orthogonal to expectancy:
it would reject this book forever while admitting a high-win-rate book that
loses money on the tails. Same non-sequitur shape as the tp-0.06 rationale
this session already refuted, except sitting in the rule that governs real
money.

THE REPLACEMENT BAR is this repo's own doctrine, applied to a whole book:
  window   >= GOLIVE_MIN_DAYS (30)      the operator's, unchanged
  evidence >= GOLIVE_MIN_CLOSES (30)    fills, never hours
  positive    mean per-trade > 0        in its own right
  SIGNIFICANT t >= GOLIVE_MIN_T (2.0)   a positive LOWER bound, not a max
  ROBUST      both halves positive      the fleet's central noise filter
  maxDD    <  GOLIVE_MAX_DD (15%)       the operator's, unchanged

Win rate is still REPORTED — it is informative — but it is not a bar.

HONEST ABOUT DIRECTION: this is not uniformly stricter. It drops a
requirement the carry book fails and adds two (significance, both-halves)
that the old rule never had. For a high-win-rate/negative-expectancy book it
is STRICTER; for carry it is what makes go-live reachable at all. That is a
real loosening for that book and is stated here rather than buried.

REGIME CAVEAT (21-Jul item 18): Lighter's tape is one falling-BTC regime, so
"both halves" is weak for anything DIRECTIONAL. Reported per book; funding
books (carry, Farmer, spread) are largely direction-agnostic so it bites less,
but a directional book passing here has passed in ONE regime only.

READ-ONLY. Grades and prints. Promotes nothing, writes no lever, flips no
dry_run — go-live remains an explicit operator act
([[no-real-money-without-explicit-golive]]).
